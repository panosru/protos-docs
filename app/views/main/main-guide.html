## Installation

    $ npm install protos
    
To have global access to the protos(1) executable, you can install the framework globally:

    $ sudo npm install -g protos
    
Global installation is the recommended installation method. If the installation fails, it might be because 
you don't have *libxml2* installed on your sistem.

Your applications will automatically inherit all [the dependencies](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/package.json) the framework provides:

    var hiredis = protos.require('hiredis');
    
## Creating an Application

To quickly create an application and get started:

    $ protos create myapp
    
You can specify more options to the create command:

    $ protos create myapp --domain protos.org --js jquery prototype --css bootstrap

The command above will create an an application in the *myapp/* directory. Will download automatically the
jQuery and Prototype libraries, and store then in *myapp/public/js* and Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework into
*myapp/public/css/bootstrap/*.

The `--domain` switch will automatically set the domain in your application's config.

To create the application with a default set of Models &amp; Controllers:

    $ protos create myapp --model users accounts --controller blog admin profile
  
For a full list of options and commands, run `protos --help`.


## Creating Application Resources

The protos command also allows you to create [Controllers](#applicaton-controllers), [Helpers](#application-views_view-helpers), 
[Models](#application-models-api), [Views](#application-views) and [Partials](#view-partials).
You _must_ be within your application's path to be able to generate new components.

### Creating Controllers

Controllers are created with the `protos controller` command. This will also create the _Helpers_ and _Views_:

    $ protos controller blog admin
    
If you don't want helpers to be automatically created, use the `--nohelper` switch.

Here's what the command above creates:

    » Created myapp/app/controllers/blog.js
    » Created myapp/app/controllers/admin.js
    » Created myapp/app/helpers/blog.js
    » Created myapp/app/helpers/admin.js
    » Created myapp/app/views/blog/blog-index.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/admin/admin-index.html

### Creating Models

Models are created with the `protos model` command:

    $ protos model posts comments
    
Here's what the command above creates:

    » Created myapp/app/models/posts.js
    » Created myapp/app/models/comments.js

### Creating Helpers

Helpers are created with the `protos helper` command:

    $ protos helper navigation sidebar
    
Here's what the command above creates:

    » Created myapp/app/helpers/navigation.js
    » Created myapp/app/helpers/sidebar.js

### Creating Views

Views are created with the `protos view` command, using the `{controller-alias}/view-name{.ext}` convention:

    $ protos view main/info blog/posts blog/comments.html admin/accounts
    
Here's the output of the command above:

    » Created myapp/app/views/main/main-info.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/blog/blog-posts.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/blog/comments.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/admin/admin-accounts.html

You can use the `--ext` option to create your views using specific extensions:

    $ protos view main/user main/test --ext jade
    
This will create your .jade templates:

    » Created myapp/app/views/main/main-user.jade
    » Created myapp/app/views/main/main-test.jade

### Creating View Partials

View Partials are created with the `protos partial` command. It uses the same convention as the views:

    $ protos view blog/post admin/sidebar
    
Here's the output of the command above:

    » Created myapp/app/views/blog/_post.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/admin/_sidebar.html
    
As with views, you can also specify the `--ext` option to create your partials using custom extensions.

### Creating Static Views

Static Views are created with the `protos static` command:

    $ protos static about contact portfolio
    
Here's the output of the command above:

    » Created myapp/app/views/__static/about.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/__static/contact.html
    » Created myapp/app/views/__static/portfolio.html
    
As with views, you can also specify the `--ext` option to create static views using custom extensions.

### Downloading CSS &amp; JavaScript Libraries

You can fetch any JavaScript or CSS Library supported by the framework. For example, run the following command anywhere 
within your application's path:

    $ protos fetch --js prototype jquery
    
This will download the latest versions of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) &amp; [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/) and place 
them inside your application's `public/js` directory.

To install CSS Libraries &amp; Frameworks, you do as such:

    $ protos fetch --css bootstrap blueprint
    
This time, you will be downloading the latest versions of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and 
[Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.org) CSS Frameworks.

You can use both `--css` and `--js` on a single command.

The framework supports client-side libraries via a simple JSON format:

- [Supported JavaScript Libraries](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/client/javascript.json)
- [Supported CSS Frameworks](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/client/css.json)

If you're interested in getting your library supported by the framework, send a Pull Request on 
[github](http://github.com/derdesign/protos).

## Running the Application's Server

Application scan be run either by calling node directly with the application's directory (or boot file) as input,
or by using the protos command to start the server.

### Using the node executable

To quickly start an application's server, you can call node with the application's directory as parameter:

    $ node myapp/
    
If you're inside the application, you can call the boot file directly:

    $ node boot.js
    
You can also run the application in a specific environment:

    $ NODE_ENV=production node myapp/

### Using the protos executable

Applications can also be started using the protos command:

    $ protos server myapp/
    
If you're located anywhere within your application's path

    $ protos server

Additionally, you can specify which environment to use:

    $ protos server --env production
    

You can run the server by forking into a new node process:

    $ protos server myapp/ --fork --logpath server.log
    
The server's stdout stream will then be redirected into the logpath you specify.

Each application can have more sophisticated logging mechanisms by using the [Logger Middleware](middleware.html#logger).

## Protos Executable

If you installed Protos globally with `npm -g install protos`, you have access to the `protos(1)` executable:

    $ protos
    Usage: protos [action] [arguments]

    Actions: [create, server, deploy, fetch, inspector] [controller, helper, model, view, partial, static]

      --domain        Domain to attach the application to (create)
      --css           Bundle client side CSS frameworks (create)
      --js            Bundle client side JavaScript libraries/frameworks (create)
      --model         Include models on application (create)
      --controller    Include controllers on application (create)
      --mustache      Use the .mustache extension for generated views (create)
      --fork          Creates a new node process when starting servers (server)
      --port          Port to use when proxying multiple servers (server)
      --env           Environment to use when running server (server)
      --logpath       File to save output when forking a new process (server)
      --nohelper      Don't create helpers when generating controllers (controller)
      --ext           Extension to use for generated normal/static/partial views (view)

    Example:

     $ protos create myapp --css bootstrap --js jquery backbone --model users --controller admin user

     Generate an application skeleton in the current directory, with the assets,
     models and controllers specified in the command.

     $ protos server myapp --fork --logpath server.log

     Starts the application's server and forks a new node process.

     For documentation, refer to http://derdesign.github.com/protos/

     protos@0.0.4 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/protos

If you did not install the framework globally, you can access the `protos(1)` command by running `bin/protos` inside the
framework's directory.

     
## Deploying a Cluster Server

Protos provides a built-in proxy that will automatically direct requests for all your applications. Behind the scenes,
it uses the [Bouncy](https://github.com/substack/bouncy) to handle the redirection.

You can deploy your applications &amp; servers using the command line or a JSON file.


### Using the commmand line

Each application runs in a separate node process, isolated from other applications. This is a secure deployment strategy,
to prevent collisions between your applications & libraries.

Applications can define how many **node processes** they will use in their respective `multiProcess` bootstrap option. 
This way, you can manually specify how many cores each application will use.

This is how you run a cluster server from the command line using the `app:port` convention:

    $ protos server mysite:8081 yoursite:8082 --port 80 --fork --logpath server.log --env production
    
This will run a proxy server on port 80, redirecting all requests to applications/ports specified.


### Using a JSON file

To deploy your applications using JSON, create a JSON file (preferably where the application directories live).

For example: create a **cluster.json** file with the following contents:

    {
      "fork": "true",
      "env": "production",
      "port": "80",
      "logpath": "server.log",
      "routes": {
        "mysite": "8081",
        "yoursite": "8082"
      }
    }

These settings are analogous to the command line example. This method is very convenient, since it allows you
to keep the deployment configuration in a single JSON file.

To run a cluster server using a JSON deployment file, run the following:

    $ protos deploy cluster.json
    
You are not limited to _cluster.json_ as the filename. The JSON file can be saved with any filename.

## Running the Node Inspector

You can easily debug your applications using the built-in [node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector). This means
you can use the regular Webkit Inspector to debug your Node.js/Protos applications. Cool!

  > Starting your application in the debug environment will automatically launch the Node Debugger. This means you can jump
  > right into the inspector as soon as you start your application.
  
To start the inspector:

    protos inspector start
    
To stop the inspector:

    protos inspector stop
    
Node inspector listens by default on http://localhost:3000

## Application Structure

The following tree contains the skeletal application structure, just after running `protos create myapp`.

### boot.js

This is the Application's [bootstrap](#the-applications-bootstrap-file-bootjs) file. It is used to specify your 
application's configuration, such as hostname, port, number of node processes to use, etc.

The bootstrap file is very flexible, since it also allows you to run code on each environment. Useful if you want to 
load different middleware configurations on each environment.

### init.js

The function in this file gets executed _after_ the application initializes (and after the `init` event).

### package.json

Package information for the application. If you remove this file, make sure you include an `index.js` file, which will
add compatibility to run the application by passing the directory where the application resides.

### app/

The app/ directory is used to store all the logic behind your application.

- **controllers**: Contains controller files
- **helpers**: Contains helper files
- **models**: Contains model files
- **views**: Contain view & layout files

### app/views

This is where all the views live. There are some special directories:

- **__layout**: Used to store the layout components, such as header, footer et al
- **__restricted**: This is where the templates such as errors &amp; notifications are stored
- **__static**: This is where the static views are located

Any other directories not mentioned above are considered to be **controller namespaces**.

### app/views/{controller-alias}

This is where the views for _controller-alias_ will be stored. These _must_ match controller aliases in order for the 
views to render correctly. This means that _BlogController_ will expect _app/views/blog/_ to exist, and so on.

If the controller's **views directory** is not found, you'll get an HTTP/500 Error. These directories are automatically
created for you.

### config/

This is where all of the application's configuration files and environment scripts are located.

You can find more information on the [Application Configuration](#application-configuration) section.

### config/env/

Files matching the current environment will be looked up here. For example: _development.js_, _production.js_, etc. The code
in these scripts will run **before** the environment functions in the [bootstrap](#the-applications-bootstrap-file-bootjs) file.

### data/

Any kind of data related to the application. This directory has been included for convenience purposes. You can store any
type of scripts and/or information here.

### incoming/

Directory to hold File Uploads. This is the upload location for the [Body Parser Middleware](middleware.html#body_parser).

### lib/

These are called _Application Extensions_, loaded when calling `app.loadExtensions()` on the [bootstrap](#the-applications-bootstrap-file-bootjs) file.

The ideal usage for these _libraries_ is to extend the core functionality of Node's classes, as well as extending the Application's methods and properties. You 
can also use this directory to extend your application with any new classes and methods.

### log/

Directory that holds the Application's log files. This is the storage location for the [Logger Middleware](middleware.html#logger).

### middleware/

Directory that holds the application-specific middleware. Any middleware specified here will override the framework's
middleware as long as it has the same name. This directory is optional.

### public/

Public directory used to serve static content

### scripts/

Application-specific scripts

### test/

Directory to store your application's test suites

## Application Configuration

The application can be configured by editing the **bootstrap** file (boot.js), or by modifying its configuration files.

### Configuration Files

The configuration files are stored in the config/ directory. Here's an explanation on what each file contains:

- **base.js**: Base application configuration, directly accessed via `app.config`
- **database.js**: Settings related to the databases.
- **regex.js**: Regular Expressions to be used by the application
- **storage.js**: Settings related to the storages
- **env/**: Holds scripts for each environment

Each file you add into the config/ directory, will be added as a property of the `app.config` object. You can access 
the database config in `app.config.database`, the regex config in `app.config.regex` and the storages config in
`app.config.storage`.

If you add a new configuration file in the config/ directory, let's say: _users.js_, then you can access this configuration
in the `app.config.users` object.

You can also remove any of the configuration files, as long as you add an extra property into the _base.js_ file. For example,
if you remove the _database.js_ file, make sure you add a `database` key inside the base configuration object in _base.js_.

This convention is really flexible if you want to separate your configuration by keeping it in logical sections & files. It
enforces greater application maintainability.

### Database Configuration

There is something special to know about the _database.js_ and _storage.js_ files. Protos introduces the term
**resource path**, to refer to a specific configuration.

The database configuration object _must_ contain a _default_ property, which contains the _resource path_ to the configuration
that will be assumed to be the default for the databases.

For example:

    {
      default: 'mongodb',
      mongodb: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 27017
      }
    }

This configuration tells the application that it will use `mongodb` as the default driver. The application will then look
for a "mongodb" property, located in the configuration. Such resource can be accessed as `drivers/mongodb`.

You can have multiple configurations for one same database. Consider the following example configuration:

    {
      default: 'mongodb:users',
      mongodb: {
        users: {
          host: 'users.host.com',
          port: 27017
        },
        clients: {
          host: 'clients.host.com,
          port: 27017
        }
      }
    }

This configuration exposes two database resources: `drivers/mongodb:users` and `drivers/mongodb:clients`.

This configuration automatically generates the Drivers, which are used to manipulate the databases. The automatically generated
drivers can be found in `app.drivers`. Storages can be located in `app.storages`.

The same **configuration conventions** apply to the Storages configuration, in the 
_storages.js_ file.


## The Application's Bootstrap File (boot.js)

This file is used to start your application. It is very slim and can do lots of things. It is automatically provided to you 
when creating your applications. Here's what it looks like:

    var Protos = require('../');

    Protos.bootstrap(__dirname, {
  
      // Server configuration
      server: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 8080,
        multiProcess: false,
        stayUp: false
      },
  
      // Application environments
      environments: {
        default: 'development',
        development: function(app) {
          app.debugLog = false;
        }
      },
  
      // Application events
      events: {
        init: function(app) {
      
          // Load middleware
          app.use('logger');
          app.use('markdown');
          app.use('body_parser');
          app.use('cookie_parser');
          app.use('static_server');
      
          // Load extensions in lib/
          app.libExtensions();

        }
      }
  
    });

    module.exports = protos.app;

Here's a detailed explanation of the several configuration sections:

### Server Configuration

- **host** &nbsp; _Hostname to bind your application to_
- **port** &nbsp; *Port your app will listen. Might get overidden on deployment or by the `PORT_OVERRIDE` env*
- **multiProcess** &nbsp; *How many node processes the application will use. If `true` will use all available cores*
- **stayUp** &nbsp; *Whether or not the server should exit on exceptions. If `true` will enable for all environments. You can
specify the environment (string) to enable this feature, or the environments (array) in which the feature will be enabled*

### Application Environments

- **default** &nbsp; *Environment to use when running the application without specifying an environment*
- **development** &nbsp; *Function to call when running on the `development` environment*
- **production** &nbsp; *Function to call when running on the `production` environment*
- **{environment-name}** &nbsp; *You can run code for any environment by specifying a function and its name*

### Application Events

- **init** &nbsp; *Function to call when the application initializes*
- **{event-name}** &nbsp; *You can run code for any event by specifying a function and the event name*

The Application's bootstrap file is the _ideal place_ to load your middleware. This is, because you can quickly configure
the middleware (and configurations to use) directly in the _boot.js_ file, without having to edit other files. This turns out very
useful when editing via SSH.

The boostrap file is ideal also to enable debugging messages in the application by setting `app.debugLog` to true.

## Applicaton Controllers

Protos inherits a few things from the [MVC Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). 
Controllers are used to _group_ common routes for a specific _namespace_, or _URL namespace_. For example, consider the following URLs:

    http://myapp.com/blog/post
    http://myapp.com/blog/archive
    http://myapp.com/blog/publish?title=Cool+Title&author=Ernie
    http://myapp.com/awesome
    http://myapp.com/admin/dashboard
    http://myapp.com/admin/account
    
If you were to create a Protos application for these, you have two approaches: Using a single Controller, or using a
controller for each of your URL namespaces.

### Using a single Controller

If you don't want to deal with multiple controllers, you can use the **MainController**, which is used to group all routes 
that belong to the root namespace, or `/`.

Here's how you would define all these in MainController:

    function MainController(app) {
      
      get('/blog/post', callback);
      get('/blog/archive', callback);
      post('/blog/publish', validation, callback);
      get('/awesome', callback);
      get('/admin/dashboard', callback);
      get('/admin/account', callback);
      
    }

In the code above, it is worth mentioning that only the _function_ source has been included. Any other requirements for node,
such as `module.exports = MainController;` have been omitted. The examples that follow will also use the same approach.

In the example above, validation is assumed to be an Object _containing  the validation rules_, and callback should be the
function to be called when the route is matched.

### Using multiple Controllers

The proper way to do things is to use a controller for each of your application's _URL namespaces_. If we recall the 
example above, we would need to use the following controlles in our Application:

- **BlogController**: _to handle requests for the blog/ namespace_
- **AdminController**: _to handle requests for the admin/ namespace_
- **MainController**: _to handle requests for /awesome_

Routes that don't match a specific controller (such as _/awesome_), should go in MainController.

If you were to create these controllers, you could use the protos executable:

    $ protos controller blog admin
    
This will create the necessary files to fully support these controllers. When you use `protos controller`, you use
the _URL namespace_ the controller should use.

The code you need for each controller is outlined below:

_&bull; app/controllers/main.js_
    
    function MainController(app) {
      
      get('/awesome', callback);
      
    }

_&bull; app/controllers/blog.js_
    
    function BlogController(app) {
      
      get('/post', callback);
      get('/archive', callback);
      post('/publish', validation, callback);
      
    }
    
_&bull; app/controllers/admin.js_
    
    function AdminController(app) {
      
      get('/dashboard', callback);
      get('/account', callback);
      
    }
  
The routes specified for a controller, are relative to the controller's namespace.

### Special Controller Aliases

If you want to handle routes with dashes, let's say:

    http://myapp.com/account-summary/show
    http://myapp.com/account-summary/set
    
Then, you can create the controller like this:

    $ protos controller account-summary
    
The framework will create **AccountSummaryController**, **AccountSummaryHelper** and all the views needed.

Here's the output of the command above:

    » Created myapp/app/controllers/account-summary.js
    » Created myapp/app/helpers/account-summary.js
    » Created myapp/app/views/account-summary/account-summary-index.html

### Related Resources

If you've noticed in the commands above, every time you create a controller, a helper is created for the controller's 
alias (which is, the _URL namespace_ the controller handles).

This done for _convenience purposes only_, and it doesn't mean that each controller needs its own helper. This is just
a way of grouping common _view helpers_ using a _prefix_ that matches the controller alias being accessed.

This will be covered with more detail in the [Helpers Section](#application-views_view-helpers).

## Routes

Routes define your application's structure. This allows using any HTTP Method to create RESTful Applications.

Each route defined is relative to the controller namespace where it has been defined.

The route functions are not global, they are local to each _controller_. This is a similar concept as with node's `__filename`,
`__dirname` and `__module` which are local to each _module_.

The examples that follow are _controller-agnostic_. Have that in mind when reading the examples. Know that they can be used with
any controller or with MainController. 

Routes defined on MainController are referred to as _global routes_.

### Route Functions

There is a route function for each HTTP Method available. The HTTP Methods supported are:

- GET _&rarr; handled by `get()`_
- POST _&rarr; handled by `post()`_
- PUT _&rarr; handled by `put()`_
- DELETE _&rarr; handled by `delete()`_
- OPTIONS _&rarr; handled by `options()`_
- TRACE _&rarr; handled by `trace()`_

This convention helps you develop RESTful Applications or APIs with ease.

  > On this document, you will probably see the route functions be referred as _Route Methods_. This is because of how they are
  > implemented internally in the framework. Whenever you see the term "Route Method", have in mind that it refers to the actual 
  > _Route Functions_.

### Route Function Arguments

The route functions can receive various types of arguments:

    get( {route}, {validation?}, {messages?}, {callback*}, {method*} );

The _validation_ and _messages_ parameters are optional. To specify _messages_, you need to specify _validation_.

You can specify as many callbacks as you want, and these will run in chain, asynchronously. Also, you can specify an array
of callbacks (which will end up flattened).

The callbacks assigned to a specific route, are usually referred to as _Route Callbacks_, not to be confused with the
_Route Functions_ (or _Route Methods_).

This section only covers arguments. The sub-sections below will cover usage with more detail.

### Simple Routes

A simple route is the one that only has _(route, callback)_, such as:

    get('/hello', function(req, res) {
      res.render('index');
    });
    
This route will cover the `/{namespace}/hello` route, and if it's global, it will then be mapped to `/hello`. The callback
specified will run **if and only if** the route and authentication (more on this later) are matched.

### Routes with Multiple Callbacks

You can run multiple callbacks as such:

    get('/resource', incrCounter, authUser, prepareData, renderView);
    
In this case, the functions _incrCounter_, _authUser_, _prepareData_ and _renderView_ will run in order. Each one of these
functions receive the exact same parameters of a Route Function.

To pass control to the next _Route Function_ in the chain, you can call `req.next()`:

    function authUser(req, res, params) {
      // ... do something ...
      req.next();
    }
    
Otherwise you can let the function take over and decide what to do with the response, in any position of the chain:

    function prepareData(rqe, res, params) {
      // ... get valid ...
      if (valid) req.next();
      else app.serverError(res, new Error("Invalid Data"));
    }

### Regular Expressions

This is an important section, since it covers topic that matter for your application's security.

You can specify validation for a specific URL Fragment, for example:

    get('/user/:user/:location', {user: 'alpha', location: 'alpha'}, function(req, res, params) {
      res.json(params);
    });

As you notice, the _validation_ parameter contains two keys matching the route fragments to validate. These are assigned the 
`alpha` value, which is the validation criteria. The validation criteria can be one of the following:

- A _Regular Expression Alias_
- A Regular Expression Object or Literal

A _Regular Expression Alias_ is a regular expression that has been defined and named in the application's regular 
expressions configuration: `app/config/regex.js`, which are also available in the `app.regex` object.

Any key present in the application's regex object is considered to be a _Regular Expression Alias_.

Each RegExp alias will validate a fragment of the URL. Internally, a master regular expression is created to validate
the entire URL.

There are some requirements for normal regular expressions to be used in routes:

- The RegExp must not contain regular expression flags. That is: `i`, `g`, `m`, etc.
- The RegExp must contain **start/end** matches, since each _fragment_ is compared in isolation from others.

That being said, the folowing regexes are valid:

    /^(one|two|three)$/
    /^john-doe$/

And these are invalid:

    /(one|two|three)/
    /john-doe/
  
Failure to meet the conditions outlined above, would result in your routes being accessed in undesirable situations, which 
might represent a security threat to your application, since sensitive data might be exposed.

### Validation of Route Parameters

Consider the following example:

    get('/user/:user/:location', {user: 'alpha', location: 'alpha'}, function(req, res, params) {
      res.json(params);
    });
    
Whenever you match url fragments, the _Route Callbacks_ will be provided with an extra argument: `params`, which is an
object containing the fragment keys and the provided values. For example:

    http://myapp.com/user/ernie/dashboard
    
The `params` argument will contain the following information:

    {
      user: "ernie",
      location: "dashboard"
    }

### Accessing Raw Query Data

Routes can define validation for query parameters. Let's suppose your application should handle this URL:

    http://myapp.com/purchase/99?quantity=1&color=red
    
Then, the route we need looks like this:

    get('/purchase/:id', {id: 'integer', quantity: 'integer', color: /^(red|green|blue)$/}, 
    function(req, res, params) {
      console.log(params);
      res.json(req.queryData);
    });
    
The validation process is a two-step process:

1. The _URL Fragment_ is validated
2. The Query Parameters are validated (manually)

The following URL would get HTTP/404, since the `:id` fragment fails to validate:

    http://myapp.com/purchase/99a?quantity=1&color=red
  
The validation for _Query Parameters_ does not happen automatically as with the url fragments validation. You can access
the query data before validating in `req.queryData`.

The URL above would render the following JSON response:

    {
      "quantity": "1",
      "color": "red1"
    }
    
As you can see, `req.queryData` contains **only** the _Query Parameters_, _not_ the URL fragments.
    
On the other hand, in the console you will see the following:

    { id: '99', quantity: undefined, color: undefined }
    
The `params` object (printed on the console) contains the value for the `id` _route parameter_. The keys belonging to the 
_query parameters_ are set to `undefined`.

### Validation of Query Parameters

Following up with the previous example, we are not interested in validating the query parameters. In the previous example,
this URL should still access the route:

    http://myapp.com/purchase/99?quantity=BLAH&color=maroon
    
Why is that? You may ask. That is, because we were accessing _Unvalidated_ (or raw) data. The Route parameter `:id` has 
been validated. The _Query Parameters_ are not yet validated, unless you want to. This is what this section is about.

To validate query parameters, the Controller instance provides a method for this: `getQueryData`.

    get('/purchase/:id', {id: 'integer', quantity: 'integer', color: /^(red|green|blue)$/}, 
    function(req, res, params) {
      this.getQueryData(req, function(fields) {
        res.json(fields);
      });
    });
    
It is important to mention, that _Route Callbacks_ **run on the controller instance's context**. This means, the `this` object
points to the controller instance currently accessing the route.

This means you have access to all the methods provided by [Controller](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/lib/controller.js).

Using `this.getQueryData` ensures that the _Query Parameters_ are validated exactly the same as the _Route Parameters_. Your
application will automatically respond with HTTP/404 on failure to validate both url fragments &amp; query parameters.

The validated fields are passed in the `fields` argument of the `getQueryData` callback.

Validation is also closely integrated with the [CSRF Middleware](middleware.html#csrf). This means, you can provide an extra
argument to `getQueryData`, and that is the _CSRF Token_, which will add an extra layer of validation. For more info, 
check out the CSRF Middleware [documentation](middleware.html#csrf).

### Validation of URL & Query Parameters

In the example above, this is exactly what has been done: Validate Query Parameters as well as Query Data.

There is only one thing to have in mind when you're validating both request &amp; query params:

  > The URL Fragments and Query Parameter names should be **different**, to prevent validation collisions. This is to prevent any 
  > unexpected behavior that can arise from this approach.

### Validation Messages
 
On validation failure, users will be responded with HTTP/400. You can specify an error message to display when data fails 
to validate. Here's how you do it: 
 
    get('/json', {
      file: 'alpha', 
      rev: 'integer'
    }, {
      file: "You must supply a valid filename",
      rev: function(rev) { return "Invalid revision: " + rev; }
    }, 
    function(req, res) {
      this.getQueryData(req, function(fields) {
        res.json(fields);
      });
    });
 
This is very powerful, and can be used in many scenarios. For example, if the following URL is accessed:

    http://myapp.com/json?file=99&rev=INVALID
    
It will fail to validate, and you will get the message _"You must supply a valid filename"_.

If a valid file is specified, and invalid revision number:

    http://myapp.com/json?file=tuesday_log&rev=INVALID

It will fail to validate, and you will get the message: _"Invalid revision: INVALID"_.

The validation messages will be displayed either in HTML or in plain text, depending on the type of request:

- For normal Requests, the response will be sent in _HTML_.
- For `XMLHttpRequest`s (AJAX), the response will be sent in _Plain Text_.
 
This behavior allows your application to use its own validation mechanisms to validate form data.
 
### Routes with multiple methods
 
You can specify a route that allows multiple HTTP Methods. Any extra arguments you pass after the _Route Callback_,
are assumed to be strings that represent which additional methods will be allowed for the route:

    get('/', function(req, res) {
      res.json({
        msg: "Hello World!",
        method: req.method
      });
    }, 'post', 'put');
    
If you access `http://myapp.com/` using `POST`, here's the response you will receive:

    {
      "msg": "Hello World!",
      "method": "POST"
    }
    
This functionality may become very useful in some situations.
 
## Controller Authentication &amp; Filters
 
  > Controller filters add an additional _authentication layer_ to your Controllers. By analyzing the _request_ and _response_
  > objects, you can determine whether or not the user is allowed to access the controller's resources.

Let's say we have the following Controller:

    function MainController(app) {
      
      get('/', function(req, res) {
        res.end("WELCOME!");
      });

      get('/:page', {page: 'alpha'}, function(req, res, params) {
        res.json(params);
      });
      
    }
    
This will respond with _"WELCOME"_ when accessing _/_, and will send a JSON response when a regular page is accessed. We'll 
implement a very basic authentication, using a GET parameter called `pass` using a _Filter_.

This is the controller code, after the filter has been implemented:

    function MainController(app) {
  
      this.authFilter(function(req, res, promise) {
        if (req.queryData.pass === '1234') promise.emit('success');
        else res.rawHttpMessage(403, true);
      });
  
      get('/', function(req, res) {
        res.end("WELCOME!");
      });
  
      get('/:page', {page: 'alpha'}, function(req, res, params) {
        res.json(params);
      });
  
    }
    
Now, if you try to access any of your controller's resources without providing the `pass` query parameter, you will not be
able to access the routes, and will be responded with a `403 Forbidden` message.

In this case, we're using `req.queryData.pass` to get the `pass` query parameter, we're not doing any validation on it, just 
getting it right as it was received. If you need validation, then `this.getQueryData` should be used.

The Authentication Filters run before any Route Functions are executed. Have this in mind when designing your Applications.

### Implementation Details

There are a few important things to know about Controller Filters to be able to use them at full potential:

- You add them by doing `this.authFilter(callback)` from within any controller
- A Controller can have multiple authentication filters by running `this.authFilter` multiple times.
- The _Filter Callback_ runs in the _Controller's Context_
- The _Filter Callback_ receives three parameters:  _request_, _response_ and _promise_
- If validation succeeded, you emit the `success` event on the promise
- If validation fails, you need to send a response manually

### Auth Filters &amp; Sessions

When using the [Sessions Middleware](middleware.html#session), it automatically provides a authentication filter for you, which
deeply integrates with both the controller and your application.

If/when you enable the _Sessions Middleware_, you can specify a property in your controllers, to determine
if such controller requires authentication: the `authRequired` property.

### The authRequired property

This only applies if the _Sessions Middleware_ is enabled. It has no effect otherwise.<br/>
For a detailed documentation on this property, refer to the _Sessions Middleware_ [documentation](middleware.html#session).


## Application Views

This section covers everything you need to know about views. Views are rendered by calling `res.render` from of your
_Route Callbacks_. The view paths will be resolved depending on the _view_ specified, as well as the running _Controller_.

### View Lookup

It is important to master the view lookup process to be able to use views at their full potential. The table below shows the 
argument passed to `res.render`, and the corresponding resolved path. 

In the table below: 

- The controller is assumed to be _MainController_. View paths are relative to _app/views/_.
- The view extensions are automatically detected, unless manually specified.

| Parameter of `res.render()` | Resolved View Path |
|----------|----------|
| index |  main/main-index.html
| index.html |  main/index.html
| @header |  __layout/header.html
| @header.mustache |  __layout/header.mustache
| @dir/view |  __layout/dir/view.html
| @dir/view.mustache |  __layout/dir/view.mustache
| #404 |  __restricted/404.html
| #404.mustache |  __restricted/404.mustache
| #dir/view |  __restricted/dir/view.html
| #dir/view.mustache |  __restricted/dir/view.mustache
| main/index |  main/main-index.html
| /main/index |  main/main-index.html
| main/index.html |  main/index.html
| /static |  __static/static.html
| /static.mustache |  __static/static.mustache

You can see how views are used by having a look at the Controllers from the [Test Suite](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/tree/master/test/fixtures/test.skeleton/app/controllers).

### View Parameters

When rendering views with `res.render`, you can pass extra parameters to the view. For example:

    res.render('index', {
      activePage: 'features',
      message: "Hello World!"
    });
    
These parameters will be available as locals within the view.

### View Locals

When rendering views, you have a set of _local variables_ you have access to inside views:

- **protos** &nbsp; _Protos global (available as local)_
- **app** &nbsp; _Application singleton_
- **req** &nbsp; _Request Object_
- **res** &nbsp; _Response Object_
- **params** &nbsp; _Pointer to `req.params`_
- **session** &nbsp; _Pointer to `req.session`_
- **cookies** &nbsp; _Pointer to `req.cookies`_
- **locals** &nbsp; _View locals object (circular reference)_

### Raw Views

Protos introduces the concept of _Raw Views_, to the views that don't render a header/footer. These are still rendered in
`text/html`, but only the requested view is rendered, not the other template parts.

> By default, the Application has _Raw Views_ disabled. You can enable _Raw Views_ globally within your application, by
> editing **config/base.js** and setting `rawViews` to true.

The _raw_ parameter is passed to `res.render` as a boolean in its last argument:

    res.render('index', {
      activePage: 'features',
      message: "Hello World!"
    }, true);
    
There are some template engines that force _Raw Views_, due to their inner workings. These are:

- Haml
- Haml-Coffee
- Jade

If you're using any of these Template Engines, then the templates won't be _MultiPart_. In other words, you will need to
do the templating and inclusion of header/footer and other parts from within the view itself. You can still use view
partials normally.
    
### View Extensions

The following table shows the view extensions for each Template Engine:

| Template Engine |  Engine Alias | View Extensions |
|-----------------|------------------|
| CoffeeKup | coffeekup | coffeekup, ck.html
| DoT | dot | dot, dot.html
| Eco | eco | eco, eco.html
| EJS | ejs | ejs, ejs.html
| Haml | haml | haml, haml.html
| Haml-Coffee | hamlcoffee | hamlc, haml.coffee, hamlc.html
| Handlebars | handlebars | handlebars, handlebars.html, hb.html
| Hogan.js | hogan | hogan, hogan.html, hg.html
| Jade | jade | jade, jade.html
| Jazz | jazz | jazz, jazz.html
| jQuery Templates | jqtpl | jqtpl, jqtpl.html, jq.html
| JSHtml | jshtml | jshtml
| Kernel | kernel | kernel, kernel.html, k.html, khtml
| Liquor | liquor | liquor, liquor.html, lq.html
| Swig | swig | swig, swig.html, sw.html
| Whiskers | whiskers | whiskers, whiskers.html, wk.html

  > You can edit and set new extensions by editing your Application's **config/base.js**, under the _engines_ section. Each
  > property you set will refer to the engine extension, and the value is the _Engine Alias_.


### Static Views

You can create routes in your application without actually creating them in Controllers. You can also place a file in the 
*app/views/__static* directory.

Let's say your application should handle the following URLs, which mostly contain static content:

    http://myapp.com/portfolio
    http://myapp.com/about

If you want to keep your routes clean, you don't need to add a simple route to handle these. Just create the following files:

    app/views/__static/portfolio.html
    app/views/__static/about.html
    
Each time you access the URLs above, these templates will be used.

## View Partials

View Partials are one of the beauties of Protos. You can mix &amp; match any view engine. Your application doesn't actually
care which template engine you use, you can still use partials.

One thing to have in mind, your template's rendering engines will work just fine. This section covers the _View Partials_, as
implemented across all the view engines within Protos.

Important things to know about view partials:

- Are exposed as local functions within your views
- Can be located anywhere within the controller's _views directory_ path
- Can be located anywhere within the *__layout* directory path
- Their filenames should start with an underscore
- The view extension determines the template engine to be used
- Partial functions *must* receive the *locals* object as argument

To learn to create view partials, refer to the [Creating View Partials](#creating-application-resources_creating-view-partials) section.

  > The View Partials are exposed as local functions within your views. Most views allow running regular JavaScript functions and
  > receiving parameters passed as their _locals_. Protos uses this common approach and exploits its full potential.

### Automatic Watching for Changes

On all environments except **production**, the framework re-compiles the view partial functions whenever any changes are made to the template files.

### Exposed Functions

The table below shows the location and the explosed function name. Paths are relative to _app/views_.

| View Partial File | Exposed View Function |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| main/\_partial.html | main\_partial
| blog/post/\_comment.html | blog\_post\_comment
| __layout/\_sidebar.html | layout\_sidebar
| __layout/widget/\_rss.html | layout\_widget\_rss

To render a view partial inside a view, just call the function. The following example uses the Liquor engine to import a view
partial into the view:

    <div class="post-comment">
      <%- blog_post_comment(locals.comments) %>;
    </div><!-- .post-comment -->


## View Helpers

View helpers are also functions that are exposed into the views. They are similar in functionality to view partials, but
they end up in the views in a slightly different way.

  > View Helpers are generated from the Methods of the Helpers defined in your Application.

Let's say you have created the following _Helpers_ in your Application:

&bull; _app/helpers/main.js_

    function MainHelper(app) {
  
      this.hello_world = function(data) {
        return JSON.stringify(data);
      }
      
    }

&bull; _app/helpers/accounts.js_

    function AccountsHelper(app) {
      
      this.show_info = function(data) {
        return JSON.stringify(data);
      }
      
    }
    
&bull; _app/helpers/dashboard.js_
    
    function DashboardHelper(app) {
      
      this.render_widget = function(data) {
        return JSON.stringify(data);
      }
      
    }

Then, your views will have the following methods exposed:

- `$hello_world`
- `$accounts_show_info`
- `$dashboard_render_widget`

The following are important things to know about View Helpers:

- Are added into the views from the _Helper Methods_ defined in your Application
- The methods exposed by _MainHelper_ are not prefixed
- The methods exposed by the other helpers are prefixed with the _helper alias_

### Default View Helpers

The framework provides a default set of helpers you can use:

- **$sanitize**: _Sanitizes input_
- **$escape**: _Escapes input_
- **$safe_str_**: _Sanitizes &amp; Escapes input_

### Accessing View Helpers

All of the application's helpers can be accessed via the `app.helpers` object, using the helper alias. Also, 
helpers can be accessed using alias properties in the Application's singleton. For example:

- `app.helpers.main` &raquo; `app.mainHelper`
- `app.helpers.utils` &raquo; `app.utilsHelper`
- `app.helpers.custom-stuff` &raquo; `app.customStuffHelper`


## Application Models &amp; API

Models provide an abstraction of data operations. Protos Models have _ORM_ built-in. They are _database-agnostic_ by nature, which
means you can define your data structure in the model, and you don't need to care about the underlying database.

Models use Drivers behind the scenes to perform database operations. The Drivers themselves perform low-level operations in the
database to manipulate the model's data.

### Defining the Driver

Each model needs a driver. Models by default inherit the _default_ driver, configured in _config/database.js_.

To connect the model with a Driver, you need to provide the Driver's _resource path_:

    this.driver = 'mongodb:users'
    
For more info on _resource paths_, please refer to the [Application Configuration](#application-configuration) section.

### Defining Properties

The model's properties defines is structure and data types. These are used for _automatic typecasting_ and _validation_ purposes.

The `properties` property defines the model's information. Here's how you set it up:

    this.properties = {
      user    : {type: 'string', required: true, validates: 'alnum_underscores'},
      pass    : {type: 'string', required: true, validates: 'password'},
      friends : {type: 'integer', validates: 'integer', default: 0},
      valid   : {type: 'boolean', default: true},
      date    : {type: 'timestamp', validates: 'timestamp', default: function() { return new Date(); }},
      object  : {type: 'object', default: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}},
      array   : {type: 'array', default: [1,2,3,4]}
    }
    
The following table explains the different keywords:

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **type**     | Type of data. Available types are: (string|integer|boolean|timestamp|object|array)
| **required** | Whether or not  the field is required
| **validates** | Regular Expression or Alias used to validate the property
| **default** | Sets the default value for the property. Accepts both values &amp; functions

  > The model will automatically typecast values to their respective JavasCript Native Objects.
  
One of the most powerful things about Protos's model implementation, are the _Object Types_. You can safely store _JavaSript
Hashes_ and _Arrays_ into model properties.

The _type_ keyword will define how the data will be typecasted. You still need to set validation rules, since validation is
a separate process.

When validating, here's how the framework knows which Regular Expression to use:

1. RegExp Literal
2. Model-Specific Validation
3. Application Regular Expression Alias

### Defining Validation

The Model Validation uses the same approach as [Route Validation](#routes). It will use the Regular Expressions defined 
by the application. Any _Regular Expression Alias_ can be used to validate fields.

There is an extra layer of validation provided by models: the `validation` property, which defines
Model-Specific validation rules. Imagine it as _Regular Expression Aliases_ that are only avaliable to the model.

Here's how you define the validation in a model:

    this.validation = {
      'account': function(str) {
        return checkAccount(str);
      },
      'username: /^(ernie|james)$/
    }

You can then use these validation aliases freely to validate your model's properties. Defining validation for the model is optional,
you can either use RegExp Literals, or the Applications' Regular Expressions.
    
### The Model API

The table below shows the Methods provided by all Model instances:

| Method | Parameters | Function |
|--------|------------|----------|
| new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | o, cdata, callback &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Creates a new model object. Saves into the database, then creates the model with the provided data.
| create | o, cdata, callback | Alias of _new_
| insert | o, cdata, callback | Same behavior as new, but instead of returning a new object, returns the ID for the new database entry.
| add | o, cdata, callback | Alias of _insert_
| get | o, cdata, callback | Gets an new model object.
| find | o, cdata, callback | Alias of _get_
| getAll | o, cdata, callback | Gets all records from the database
| findAll | o, cdata, callback | Alias of _getAll_
| save | o, cdata, callback | Saves the model data into the Database.
| update | o, cdata, callback | Alias of _save_
| delete | o, cdata, callback | Deletes the model data from the database.
| destroy | o, cdata, callback | Alias of _delete_

Here's the meaning of the Parameters:

- **o** &nbsp; _Object containing the model properties to query_
- **cdata** &nbsp; _[Cache Data](#database-drivers_cache-keywords) to pass to the driver: [ cacheID, cacheInvalidate, cacheTimeout ]_
- **callback** &nbsp; _Callback to call upon completion_

### Application's Model Methods

Models can be accessed in several ways. All models expose things in a similar way, so explaining with a single model would
be enough to understand the concept. For the sake of this example, we'll assume _UsersModel_.

The _UsersModel_ instance can be accessed via `app.usersModel` and `app.models.usersModel`. Each model instance has the methods
documented in the previous section.

The table below shows the model methods and their equivalent:

| Method |  Equivalent |
|--------|-------------|
| app.model.newUser | app.usersModel.new
| app.model.createUser | app.usersModel.create
| app.model.insertUser | app.usersModel.insert
| app.model.addUser | app.usersModel.add
| app.model.getUser | app.usersModel.get
| app.model.findUser | app.usersModel.find
| app.model.findAllUsers | app.usersModel.findAll
| app.model.saveUser | app.usersModel.save
| app.model.updateUser | app.usersModel.update
| app.model.deleteUser | app.usersModel.delete
| app.model.destroyUser | app.usersModel.destroy


### The Model Generator Concept

Protos introduces the _"Model Generator"_ concept. In JavaScript &amp; Node.js, most callbacks are asynchronous. This makes the
usual ORM approach to create an object and _then_ synchronously saving its settings is not that intuitive with most database 
modules running asynchronously.

Each _Model Instance_ is itself a _Model Generator_. The term can also be interchangeable with _Model Factory_.

The Model Object does not operate directly on model objects. _Model Objects_ (introduced on the next section) use the methods
provided by the Model API, to perform the CRUD operations.

  > Model Generators are used to retrieve a group of_ Models Objects_. The returned objects will be directly related to the parameters
  > you pass to the Model Generator's method.

The term exists to make a _distinction_ between the object that _generates_, and the object that is _generated_.

### The Model Object Concept

Model Objects are individually retrieved by _Model Generators_. They contain a set of methods totally different from the ones
found in the _Model Generator_.

  > Relationships defined in Models expose their own methods into the Model Objects created by the Models
  
The sections below will explain in detail which methods are exposed by each relationship. If multiple relationships are set 
on the model (either _Inbound_ or _Outbound_), their specific methods will end up in the Model Object.

You can access the Model Object's prototype via the `modelObjectProto` on the Model Instance. In this case, the term "Model" refers
to the _Model Generator_. The object is itself bound to the `__proto__` property of all model instances. The real prototype is 
found on `modelObjectProto.constructor.prototype`.

Each Model Object as a `generator` property, which points to the _Model Generator_ that created it.

Model Objects are analogous to the models you see in other Application Frameworks or ORM Implementations. The following table
shows the Methods provided by the Model Object's _Prototype_:

| Method | Arguments | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| save | cdata, callback | Saves the model data
| update | cdata, callback | Alias of _save_
| sync | cdata, callback | Alias of _save_ 
| delete | cdata, callback | Removes model
| remove | cdata, callback | Alias of _delete_
| destroy | cdata, callback | Alias of _delete_
| createMulti | options | Creates a multi-wrapped object from Model Object

Here's the meaning of the Parameters:

- **cdata** &nbsp; _[Cache Data](#database-drivers_cache-keywords) to pass to the driver: [ cacheID, cacheInvalidate, cacheTimeout ]_
- **callback** &nbsp; _Callback to call upon completion_
- **options** &nbsp; _Options to pass to the Multi constructor_

### Query Caching

Models inherit query caching because they have a Driver under the hood. This means that they automatically receive the 
caching functionality. 100% Free.

### Model Relationships

Protos implements relationships between models. Relationships allow _Model Objects_ to connect with other model objects, adding
the additional ability to perform actions on such relationships.

Relationships only affect _Model Objects_. Each relationship, depending if it is _Inbound_ or _Outbound_, will modify either
the source or the destination model.

  > The Relationships implementation makes use of **Linguistic Inflection**, so the names should be specified in a specific form, either
  > _plural_ or _singular_ depending on the relationship being established.

An **Inbound** Relationship is where the _source_ model is the target receiving the link to the _destination_ model.

An **Outbound** Relationship is where the _destination_ model is the target receiving the link to the _source_ model.

The sections below explain the relationships, and their specific requirements and exposed methods.
 
### hasOne Relationship

This is an _Inbound_ relationship, affecting the model which establishes the connection. This relationship consists on the following:

  > The model establishing a connection, receives a one-to-one connection with the target model. A _string_ property will be assigned into the
  > Model Generator, which will define the link to the destination model.

Here's how you set a _hasOne_ relationship:

    this.hasOne = 'user';
    
The target model _must_ be specified in _singular form_. This relationship will set a `user` property into the _Model Generator_, which
links to a _Model Object_ of _UsersModel_.

Additionally, you can set the relationship to an _alias_ of the target model. This allows you to use a different property other
than the singular form of the target model:

    this.hasOne = 'buddy(user)';
    
This will set a `buddy` property into the _Model Generator_, which links to a _Model Object_ of _UsersModel_.

Based on the property assigned, the _Model Object_'s prototype will be extended with new methods. The following table outlines
the inherited methods on the _Model Object_ establishing the relationship. A property of `user` is assumed to be added:

| Method | Arguments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Provides | Description |  
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| getUser | callback | err, model | Gets the linked model
| setUser | model/id, callback | err | Links model to self
| removeUser | callback | err | Breaks the relationship with model
| deepRemoveUser | callback | err | Breaks relationship with model and deletes the unlinked model from database

Assuming _AccountsModel_ has set the relationship, the following example shows how to use the relationship:

    app.model.getAccount({id: 99}, function(err, account) {
      account.deepRemoveUser(function(err) {
        if (err) throw err;
        else console.exit("Successfully unlinked & removed user from account"); // Account now has no user linked
      });
    });

### hasMany Relationship

This is an _Inbound_ relationship, affecting the model which establishes the connection. This relationship consists on the following:

The model establishing the connection receives a one-to-many connection with the target model. An _array_ property will be assigned
into the Model Generator, which will define the links to the destination model.

Here's how you set a _hasMany_ relationship:

    this.hasMany = 'users';
    
You can also specify an array of target models:

    this.hasMany = ['groups', 'buddies(users)']
    
Aliases work exactly the same for this relationship as well. The only difference is that _plural form_ must be used to define the target models.

The example above will set a `groups` array property into the _Model Generator_, which contains links to _Model Objects_ of _GroupsModel_. Additionally,
a `users` property will be added, containing links to _Model Objects_ of _UsersModel_.

Based on the property assigned, the _Model Object_'s prototype will be extended with new methods. The following table outlines
the inherited methods on the _Model Object_ establishing the relationship. A property of `buddies` is assumed to be added:

| Method | Arguments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Provides&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |  
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| addBuddy | model/id, callback | err | Appends a link to model in self. Restricts to a single item.
| addBuddies | array, callback | err | Connects Models or ID's connected in array with self
| getBuddy | model/id, callback | err, model | Gets a linked model
| getBuddies | array, callback | err, models | Retrieves the specified models (as long as a connection exists)
| removeBuddy | model/id, callback | err | Unlinks the model from self. Restricts to a single item.
| removeBuddies | array, callback | err | Breaks the relationsip with the specifeid models/ids (as long as a connection exists)
| deepRemoveBuddy | model/id, callback | err | Breaks relationship with model and deletes the unlinked model from database. Restricts to a single item.
| deepRemoveBuddies | array, callback | err | Breaks relationship with models and deletes the unlinked models from database.

Assuming _UsersModel_ set the relationship, the following example shows how to use the relationship:

    // we got buddy earlier
    
    app.model.getUser({name: 'ernie'}, function(err, user) {
      if (err) throw err;
      else user.addBuddy(buddy, function(err) {
         if (err) throw err;
         else console.exit("Buddy and User are now pals");
      });
    });

### belongsTo Relationship

This is an _Outbound_ relationship. Setting this relationship is exactly the same as setting a _hasOne_ relationship, but swapping
source and destination models. 

For example:

    // Relationship being set from UsersModel

    this.belongsTo = 'company.boss'
    
Assuming the relationship is being set by _UsersModel_, this would translate to:

    // Relationship as translated into CompaniesModel
    
    this.hasOne = 'boss(user)';
    
The same rules for _hasOne_ apply. You need to specify `{target-model}.{target-property}`. Both the _target model_ and _target property_
should be specified in _Singular Form_.

### belongsToMany Relationship

This is an _Outbound_ relationship. Setting this relationship is exactly the same as setting a _hasMany_ relationship, but swapping
the source and destination models.

For example:

    // Relationship as being set from UsersModel
    
    this.belongsToMany = 'company.employees'
    
Assuming the relationship is being set from _UsersModel_, this would translate to:

    // Relationship as translated into CompaniesModel
    
    this.hasMany = 'employees(users)';
    
The same rules for _hasMany_ apply. You need to specify `{target-model}.{target-property}`. The _target model_ is specified in 
_Singular Form_, and the _target property_ should be specified in _plural form_.


## Database Drivers

Drivers provide a set of methods to operate with the underlying database, as well as a _Model API Implementation_, which allows
the driver to be used with a Model.
  
Besides handling model internal operations, Drivers can be used by themselves. Here's how you get a _Driver Instance_ so you
can work with it:

    app.getResource('drivers/mongodb:users', function(driver) {
      console.exit(driver);
    });
    
You specify the _resource path_ to the Driver you want to use. Such driver uses the configuration specified in 
_config/database.js_. Driver instances are available via `app.drivers`.

Protos implements the following Drivers, which can be used to power Models:

- [MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/drivers/mongodb.js)
- [MySQL](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/drivers/mysql.js)

If you're interested in contributing a new Database Driver, you're welcome to do so. You have a clean API to work with, so
it's pretty easy to implement new Database Drivers into the framework. Also, the source has been documented properly.
    
  
### Query Caching

You can attach a Storage into a Driver, which will be used as the underlying _Cache Storage_ for such driver.

The Storage you define in the Driver's configuration will be inherited by the Model that uses it.
  
To enable query caching in a driver, just specify the _Resource Path_ pointing to the storage you want to use
as the caching layer. This is done in the Database configuration, on _config/database.js_.

### Cache Keywords

The following extra properties can be specified to trigger cache operations:

- **cacheID** &nbsp; This will set the ID for the current cache. If the cache is not stored, the retrieved query will then be cached. 
Any subsequent queries will return the cached result. This will happen until the cache is _invalidated_.
- **cacheInvalidate** &nbsp; This will invalidate a cacheID, and will force any subsequent queries to regenerate the cache for the specified ID.
- **cacheTimeout** &nbsp; Amount of seconds in which the cacheID will be invalidated. The effect will be the same as cacheInvalidate. This only works if the storage
backend supports TTL Expiration.

This approach is both useful and interesting. Imagine you have a heavy query in your homepage, you need to retrieve 100 records in a 
rather expensive query. You can then cache the query using the ID `homepage_query`.

The cache will always be valid, _unless_ a new user is added. So, whenever you add a new user you need to _invalidate_ the `homepage_query`, so
the next time the homepage is accessed, the cache will be regenerated, this time accounting for the new user that has just been
created.

Internally, this all is done behind the scenes, and in a very organized way. You don't need to set any timeouts (even though you can), since
the cache will remain valid until something invalidates it.

### Cache storage

This example uses the [MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/drivers/mongodb.js) driver to cache the `homepage_query`:

    mongodb.queryAll({
      collection: 'users',
      fields: {'user': 1, 'pass': 1},
      cacheID: 'homepage_query',
    }, function(err, docs) {
      console.log([err, docs]);
    });
    
Any subsequent queries you perform with this cacheID, will return the cached content if it exists, otherwise it will query the 
records and cache the results into the `homepage_query` ID. This will happen until the cache is invalidated.

### Cache Invalidation

This example uses the [MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/drivers/mongodb.js) driver to invalidate the `homepage_query` cache:

    mongodb.insertInto({
      collection: 'users',
      values: {user: 'hello', pass: 'passme'},
      cacheInvalidate: 'homepage_query'
    }, function(err, docs) {
      console.log([err, docs]);
    });
    
This query will invalidate the `homepage_query` cache, and will force any subsequent requests to regenerate it.

## Storages API

Storages provide a common transport which can be used as a caching layer, or as a storage layer for the Application, 
Drivers and Models.

Storages are configured in _config/storage.js_. Here's how you get a storage:

    app.getResource('storages/redis:session', function(storage) {
      console.exit(storage);
    });
    
All storages implement a common API, that provide a layer of abstraction between two endpoints. The following table explains
the Storage API Methods:

| Method | Arguments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Provides&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| get | key, callback | err, results | Retrieves one or more records from the storage backend (key accepts string/array)
| getHash | key, callback | err, hash | Retrieves a hash from the storage backend
| set | key, value, callback | err | Inserts one or more records into the storage backend. Key can also be an object with keys/values (skip value)
| setHash | key, hash, callback | err | Inserts a hash (object) into the storage backend
| updateHash |  key, object, callback | err | Updates a hash with new values in object
| deleteFromHash | hash, key, callback | err  | Deletes one or more keys from a specific hash
| delete | key, callback | err | Deletes one or more records from the storage backend
| rename | oldkey, newkey | err | Renames a key
| expire | key, timeout, callback | err  |  Makes a specific key expire in a certain amount of time (only on backends that support TTL)
| multi | config | N/A | Allows execution of multiple storage operations

All the methods have the same effect, regardless of which storage backend you use. You are guaranteed to receive the same results.

### Available Storages

Protos provides the following Storages:

- [MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/storages/mongodb.js)
